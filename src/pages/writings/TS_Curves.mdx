## Ts-Curves

#### Just input the progress and get your curve, it's that simple. as well keep in mind that _progess is inbetween **0 to 1**._

### Features

- Typescript Intellisense

- Include definations for most of easing curves, So you would not need to check browser for what does this curve do,

- Most of the Curves Taken from flutter Official repo [link](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/animation/curves.dart)

# Curves

## DecelerateCurve: Decelerate()

### A curve where the rate of change starts out quickly and then decelerates; an upside-down `f(t) = t²` parabola.

## fastLinearToSlowEaseIn: `0.18, 1.0, 0.04, 1.0`

### A curve that is **very steep and linear at the beginning**, but **quickly flattens out** and **very slowly eases in**

By default is the curve used to animate pages on iOS back to their original
position if a swipe gesture is ended midway through a swipe.

## ease: `0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0`

### A cubic animation curve that **speeds up quickly** and **ends slowly**.

## easeInSine: `0.47, 0.0, 0.745, 0.715`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends quickly**.

This is similar to [Curves.easeIn], but with sinusoidal easing for a slightly less
abrupt beginning and end. Nonetheless, the result is quite gentle and is
hard to distinguish from [Curves.linear] at a glance.

## easeInExpo: `0.95, 0.05, 0.795, 0.035`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends quickly**.

This curve is based on an exponential equation where `f(t) = 2¹⁰⁽ᵗ⁻¹⁾`.

Using this curve can give your animations extra flare, but a longer
duration may need to be used to compensate for the steepness of the curve.

Compared to [Curves.easeInQuint], this curve is slightly steeper.

Derived from Robert Penner’s easing functions.

## easeInBack: `0.6, -0.28, 0.735, 0.045`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends quickly**.

reaching its end. Instead of repeated swinging motions before ascending,
though, this curve overshoots once, then continues to ascend.

Since two curves are used as a basis for this curve, the resulting
animation will overshoot its bounds twice before reaching its end - first
by exceeding its lower bound, then exceeding its upper bound and finally descending to its final position.

Derived from Robert Penner’s easing functions.

## SlowInFastOut `0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0`

### A curve that **starts quickly** and **eases into its final position**.

Over the course of the animation, the object spends more time near its
final destination. As a result, the user isn’t left waiting for the
animation to finish, and the negative effects of motion are minimized.
