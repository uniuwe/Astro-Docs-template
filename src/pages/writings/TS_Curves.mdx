## Ts-Curves

#### Just input the progress and get your curve, it's that simple. as well keep in mind that _progess is inbetween **0 to 1**._

### Features

- Typescript Intellisense

- Include definations for most of easing curves, So you would not need to check browser for what does this curve do,

## Mention

- Most of the Curves Taken from flutter Official repo [link](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/animation/curves.dart)

# Curves

## DecelerateCurve: Decelerate()

### A curve where the rate of change starts out quickly and then decelerates; an upside-down `f(t) = t¬≤` parabola.

## fastLinearToSlowEaseIn: `0.18, 1.0, 0.04, 1.0`

### A curve that is **very steep and linear at the beginning**, but **quickly flattens out** and **very slowly eases in**

By default is the curve used to animate pages on iOS back to their original
position if a swipe gesture is ended midway through a swipe.

## ease: `0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0`

### A cubic animation curve that **speeds up quickly** and **ends slowly**.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69889565/182573929-32e567eb-0c5a-4410-90ef-c8f44482e9eb.mp4

## easeIn: `0.42, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends quickly**.

## easeInToLinear: `0.67, 0.03, 0.65, 0.09`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends linearly**.

The symmetric animation to [linearToEaseOut].

## easeInSine: `0.47, 0.0, 0.745, 0.715`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends quickly**.

This is similar to [Curves.easeIn], but with sinusoidal easing for a slightly less
abrupt beginning and end. Nonetheless, the result is quite gentle and is
hard to distinguish from [Curves.linear] at a glance.

Animations using this curve or steeper curves will benefit from a longer
duration to avoid motion feeling unnatural.

## easeInExpo: `0.95, 0.05, 0.795, 0.035`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends quickly**.

This curve is based on an exponential equation where `f(t) = 2¬π‚Å∞‚ÅΩ·µó‚Åª¬π‚Åæ`.

Using this curve can give your animations extra flare, but a longer
duration may need to be used to compensate for the steepness of the curve.

Compared to [Curves.easeInQuint], this curve is slightly steeper.

## easeInCirc: `0.6, 0.04, 0.98, 0.335`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends quickly**.

## easeInBack: `0.6, -0.28, 0.735, 0.045`

### A cubic animation curve that **starts slowly** and **ends quickly**.

This curve is similar to [Curves.elasticIn] in that it overshoots its bounds before
reaching its end. Instead of repeated swinging motions before ascending,
though, this curve overshoots once, then continues to ascend.

This curve can be imagined as [Curves.easeInBack] as the first half, and [Curves.easeOutBack] as the second.

Since two curves are used as a basis for this curve, the resulting
animation will overshoot its bounds twice before reaching its end - first
by exceeding its lower bound, then exceeding its upper bound and finally descending to its final position.

## SlowInFastOut `0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0`

### A curve that **starts quickly** and **eases into its final position**.

Over the course of the animation, the object spends more time near its
final destination. As a result, the user isn‚Äôt left waiting for the
animation to finish, and the negative effects of motion are minimized.
